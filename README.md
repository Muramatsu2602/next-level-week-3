# Next Level Week 3
Web development bootcamp offered by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) . It is important to note that this project's layout was 100% based on [this design](https://www.notion.so/Layout-Happy-OmniStack-faac4d4d638343fe8bab627125a7557c), which was also provided by the forementioned bootcamp.

## The Project
Introducing "Happy", a web-based plataform that aims to connect volunteers to local kids orphanage homes in Brazil. From basic info to actually conecting both parts together, "Happy" is a all-in-on solution!

## Tools
### Yarn
It's like NPM, meaning that it's a package manager. But, in this case, it performs better for more complex projects

## Running the Application
In order to run this project locally using Nodemon, use this command
```bash
npm run dev
```
For testing the database using some fake data, try this
```bash
node src/database/test.js
```
